# Problem Statement :
We own a parking lot that can hold up to ‘n’ cars at any given point in time. Each slot is given a number starting at one increasing with increasing distance from the entry point in steps of one. We want to create an automated ticketing system that allows our customers to use our parking lot without human intervention.

When a car enters the parking lot, we want to have a ticket issued to the driver. The ticket issuing process includes :-
   1. We are taking note of the number written on the vehicle 
   registration plate and the age of the driver of the car.
   2. And we are allocating an available parking slot to the car 
   before actually handing over a ticket to the driver (we assume 
   that our customers are kind enough to always park in the slots 
   allocated to them).

The customer should be allocated a parking slot that is nearest to the entry. At the exit, the customer returns the ticket, marking the slot they were using as being available.

Due to government regulation, the system should provide us with the ability to find out :-
- Vehicle Registration numbers for all cars which are parked by the driver of a certain age.
- Slot number in which a car with a given vehicle registration plate is parked.
- Slot numbers of all slots where cars of drivers of a particular age are parked.

We get the input by reading input.txt directly (you will have to create it in your environment). The file will contain a set of commands separated by a newline, we need to execute the commands in order and produce output.

## File Mode (File Input) :
- Command to run : python car_parking.py input.txt

## Note
### Time Complexity
- To park a car : O(log(n)). Here, n is the size of the min heap.
- To remove a car (leaving a particular slot) : O(log(n)). Here, n is the size of the min heap.
- To retrieve a car by driver_age (retrieve slot number from driver_age) : O(m). Here, m is the size of the hash map.
- To retrieve a car by registration number (retrieve slot number from vehicle registration number) : O(m). Here, m is the size of the hash map.
- To get status (retrieve vehicle registration number from driver_age) : O(m). Here, m is the size of the hash map.
